# **Linux File Ownership & Access Control for DevOps Engineers**

## **What You Will Learn**
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:  
✔️ Check and understand **file permissions & ownership** using `ls -l`  
✔️ Modify file permissions using `chmod` (symbolic and numeric modes)  
✔️ Change file ownership using `chown` and manage group-based access  
✔️ Secure sensitive files such as **SSH keys & deployment scripts**  
✔️ Prevent accidental file deletion using `chattr +i`  
✔️ Recursively change ownership & permissions for **web servers & log files**  
✔️ Apply real-world **DevOps use cases** related to **scripts, logs, and automation**  

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before we begin, ensure your system has the required files, users, and groups.

### **1. Ensure the DevOps User and Group Exist**
Check if `devopsuser` exists:
```bash
id devopsuser
```
If it does not exist, create it:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash devopsuser
sudo passwd devopsuser
```
Now, check if the `devops` group exists:
```bash
getent group devops
```
If it does not exist, create it and add `devopsuser`:
```bash
sudo groupadd devops
sudo usermod -aG devops devopsuser
```

### **2. Create a Deployment Script**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www
sudo touch /var/www/deploy.sh
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\necho "Deploying application..."' | sudo tee /var/www/deploy.sh > /dev/null
sudo chmod 000 /var/www/deploy.sh
sudo chown root:root /var/www/deploy.sh
```

Now, check the file:
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```
✅ **Expected Output:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 devopsuser devops  1024 Feb 20 10:00 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

---

# **Scenario 1: Checking File Permissions & Ownership**
### **Why is this important?**
Before executing `deploy.sh`, the DevOps team must verify **who has access**.

### **Check File Permissions**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```
📌 **Example Output:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 devopsuser devops  1024 Feb 20 10:00 deploy.sh
```

### **Understanding File Permission Structure**
| Position | Meaning | Example (-rwxr-xr--) |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **1st**  | File Type | `-` (file) or `d` (directory) |
| **2nd-4th** | Owner’s Permissions | `rwx` (read, write, execute) |
| **5th-7th** | Group Permissions | `r-x` (read, execute) |
| **8th-10th** | Others’ Permissions | `r--` (read-only) |

✅ **Takeaway:** If the script is not executable, the deployment process may fail.

---

# **Scenario 2: Changing File Ownership**
### **Why is this important?**
By default, files created by `root` can only be modified by `root`. A DevOps engineer needs access to `deploy.sh`.

### **Check Current Ownership**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Change File Ownership to a DevOps User**
```bash
sudo chown devopsuser /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Change Both Owner and Group**
```bash
sudo chown devopsuser:devops /var/www/deploy.sh
```

✅ **Expected Output:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 devopsuser devops  1024 Feb 20 10:00 /var/www/deploy.sh
```
Now, **devopsuser** owns the script, and **devops group members** can access it.

---

# **Scenario 3: Changing File Permissions**
### **Why is this important?**
To ensure **security and proper execution**, a DevOps engineer needs to adjust file permissions.

### **Grant Execute Permission to the Owner**
```bash
chmod u+x /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Remove Write Permission from the Group**
```bash
chmod g-w /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Remove Read Permission for Others**
```bash
chmod o-r /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Verify Permissions**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```

✅ **Expected Output:**
```
-rwxr-x---  1 devopsuser devops  1024 Feb 20 10:00 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

---

# **Scenario 4: Setting Permissions Using Numeric Mode**
### **Why is this important?**
Numeric mode provides **precise control** over file permissions.

### **Set Owner Full Access, Group Read-Execute, Others Read**
```bash
chmod 754 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

📌 **Permission Breakdown:**
| User | Permission | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Owner** | `rwx` (read, write, execute) | 7 (4+2+1) |
| **Group** | `r-x` (read, execute) | 5 (4+1) |
| **Others** | `r--` (read-only) | 4 (4) |

✅ **This ensures:**  
- The owner can modify and execute the script.  
- Group members can execute but not modify the script.  
- Others can only read it.

---

# **Scenario 5: Managing Group-Based Access**
### **Why is this important?**
If multiple engineers need access to `deploy.sh`, they should **not modify it accidentally**.

### **Add a User to the DevOps Group**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG devops newuser
```

✅ Now, `newuser` **can execute the script** without modifying it.

---

# **Scenario 6: Securing Sensitive Files (SSH Private Keys)**
### **Why is this important?**
SSH keys should **never be readable by others**.

### **Restrict SSH Key Access**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

📌 **Now:**
- **Only the owner** can read/write.

✅ **This prevents unauthorized SSH access.**

---

# **Scenario 7: Preventing Accidental File Deletion**
### **Why is this important?**
Critical log files should **never be deleted accidentally**.

### **Make a File Immutable**
```bash
sudo chattr +i /var/log/deploy.log
```
📌 Now, **even `root` cannot delete it**.

### **Remove the Immutable Attribute**
```bash
sudo chattr -i /var/log/deploy.log
```

✅ **This protects log files from unintended deletions.**

---

# **Scenario 8: Recursively Changing Ownership & Permissions**
### **Why is this important?**
Web servers need correct permissions for all files and directories.

### **Change Ownership for an Entire Directory**
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
```

### **Apply Secure Permissions to All Files & Folders**
```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

✅ **Expected Result:**  
- **Files** are readable and executable.  
- **Directories** remain accessible.

---

## **Final Takeaways**
✔️ **Check permissions** before executing scripts.  
✔️ **Use `chown`** to assign proper ownership.  
✔️ **Set strict permissions** on sensitive files.  
✔️ **Use groups** to manage shared access.  
✔️ **Protect critical logs from accidental deletion.**

## **Hands-On Challenge**
Set up `/var/www/project` with:
- **www-data** as the owner.
- **755** for directories.
- **644** for files.
