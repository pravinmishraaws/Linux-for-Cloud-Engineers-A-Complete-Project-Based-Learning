# **Linux File Ownership & Access Control for DevOps Engineers**

## **What You Will Learn**
By the end of this guide, you will be able to:  
‚úîÔ∏è Check and understand **file permissions & ownership** using `ls -l`  
‚úîÔ∏è Modify file permissions using `chmod` (symbolic and numeric modes)  
‚úîÔ∏è Change file ownership using `chown` and manage group-based access  
‚úîÔ∏è Secure sensitive files such as **SSH keys & deployment scripts**  
‚úîÔ∏è Prevent accidental file deletion using `chattr +i`  
‚úîÔ∏è Recursively change ownership & permissions for **web servers & log files**  
‚úîÔ∏è Apply real-world **DevOps use cases** related to **scripts, logs, and automation**  

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before we begin, ensure your system has the required files, users, and groups.

### **1. Ensure the DevOps User and Group Exist**
Check if `devopsuser` exists:
```bash
id devopsuser
```
If it does not exist, create it:
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash devopsuser
sudo passwd devopsuser
```
Now, check if the `devops` group exists:
```bash
getent group devops
```
If it does not exist, create it and add `devopsuser`:
```bash
sudo groupadd devops
sudo usermod -aG devops devopsuser
```

### **2. Create a Deployment Script**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www
sudo touch /var/www/deploy.sh
echo -e '#!/bin/bash\necho "Deploying application..."' | sudo tee /var/www/deploy.sh > /dev/null
sudo chmod 000 /var/www/deploy.sh
sudo chown root:root /var/www/deploy.sh
```

Now, check the file:
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output:**
```
---------- 1 root root 44 Feb 21 05:31 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

---

# **Scenario 1: Checking File Permissions & Ownership**
### **Why is this important?**
Before executing `deploy.sh`, the DevOps team must verify **who has access**.

üìå **Example: yes, this is example to understand:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 xxuser xxgroup  1024 Feb 20 10:00 deploy.sh
```

### **Understanding File Permission Structure**
| Position | Meaning | Example (-rwxr-xr--) |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **1st**  | File Type | `-` (file) or `d` (directory) |
| **2nd-4th** | Owner‚Äôs Permissions | `rwx` (read, write, execute) |
| **5th-7th** | Group Permissions | `r-x` (read, execute) |
| **8th-10th** | Others‚Äô Permissions | `r--` (read-only) |

‚úÖ **Takeaway:** If the script is not executable, the deployment process may fail.

---

# **Scenario 2: Changing File Ownership**
### **Why is this important?**
By default, files created by `root` can only be modified by `root`. A DevOps engineer needs access to `deploy.sh`.

### **Check Current Ownership**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Change File Ownership to a DevOps User**
```bash
sudo chown devopsuser /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Change Both Owner and Group**
```bash
sudo chown devopsuser:devops /var/www/deploy.sh
```

‚úÖ **Expected Output:**
```
-rwxr-xr--  1 devopsuser devops  1024 Feb 20 10:00 /var/www/deploy.sh
```
Now, **devopsuser** owns the script, and **devops group members** can access it.

---

# **Scenario 3: Changing File Permissions**
### **Why is this important?**

## **Understanding File Permissions and Adjusting Them for Secure Execution**

### **Current File Permissions:**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```
‚úÖ **Example Output:**
```
---------- 1 root root 44 Feb 21 05:31 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Breaking Down the Current Permissions**
| Position | Meaning | Current Value (`----------`) |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **1st**  | File Type | `-` (regular file) |
| **2nd-4th** | Owner‚Äôs Permissions | `---` (no read, write, or execute) |
| **5th-7th** | Group Permissions | `---` (no read, write, or execute) |
| **8th-10th** | Others‚Äô Permissions | `---` (no read, write, or execute) |

üö® **Problem:**  
- **The owner, group, and others have NO permissions at all!**  
- The script **cannot be read, modified, or executed** by anyone.

---

## **Why is This Important?**
Before executing a deployment script, a **DevOps engineer must ensure the correct permissions** are in place:  
‚úîÔ∏è **The owner should be able to execute the script.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Group members should have limited access.**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Others should have NO access for security reasons.**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Switch to Root User (Required)**
Since the file is owned by `root`, **only root can modify permissions**. Switch to the root user:
```bash
sudo su -
```
Now, confirm you are the root user:
```bash
whoami
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output:**
```
root
```

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Adjusting File Permissions**
### **üîπ Grant Execute Permission to the Owner**
```bash
chmod u+x /var/www/deploy.sh
```
üìå **Now, the owner (`root`) can execute the script.**

### **üîπ Remove Write Permission from the Group**
```bash
chmod g-w /var/www/deploy.sh
```
üìå **The group can read but not modify the file.**

### **üîπ Remove Read Permission for Others**
```bash
chmod o-r /var/www/deploy.sh
```
üìå **Others cannot view the script, enhancing security.**

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Updated Permissions**
```bash
ls -l /var/www/deploy.sh
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output:**
```
-rwxr-x---  1 root root  44 Feb 21 05:31 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

### **Breaking Down the Updated Permissions**
| Position | Meaning | Updated Value (`-rwxr-x---`) |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| **1st**  | File Type | `-` (regular file) |
| **2nd-4th** | Owner (`root`) | `rwx` (read, write, execute) |
| **5th-7th** | Group (`root`) | `r-x` (read & execute) |
| **8th-10th** | Others | `---` (no access) |

‚úÖ **Final Permissions:**
‚úî **Root can execute, modify, and read the script.**  
‚úî **Group members can read & execute but not modify.**  
‚úî **Others have NO access for security.**


---

# **Scenario 4: Setting Permissions Using Numeric Mode**
### **Why is this important?**
Numeric mode provides **precise control** over file permissions.

### **Set Owner Full Access, Group Read-Execute, Others Read**
```bash
chmod 754 /var/www/deploy.sh
```

üìå **Permission Breakdown:**
| User | Permission | Value |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Owner** | `rwx` (read, write, execute) | 7 (4+2+1) |
| **Group** | `r-x` (read, execute) | 5 (4+1) |
| **Others** | `r--` (read-only) | 4 (4) |

‚úÖ **This ensures:**  
- The owner can modify and execute the script.  
- Group members can execute but not modify the script.  
- Others can only read it.

---

# **Scenario 5: Managing Group-Based Access**
### **Why is this important?**
If multiple engineers need access to `deploy.sh`, they should **not modify it accidentally**.

### **Add a User to the DevOps Group**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG devops newuser
```

‚úÖ Now, `newuser` **can execute the script** without modifying it.

---

# **Scenario 6: Securing Sensitive Files (SSH Private Keys)**
### **Why is this important?**
SSH keys should **never be readable by others**.

### **Restrict SSH Key Access**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

üìå **Now:**
- **Only the owner** can read/write.

‚úÖ **This prevents unauthorized SSH access.**

---

# **Scenario 7: Preventing Accidental File Deletion**
### **Why is this important?**
Critical log files should **never be deleted accidentally**.

### **Make a File Immutable**
```bash
sudo chattr +i /var/log/deploy.log
```
üìå Now, **even `root` cannot delete it**.

### **Remove the Immutable Attribute**
```bash
sudo chattr -i /var/log/deploy.log
```

‚úÖ **This protects log files from unintended deletions.**

---

# **Scenario 8: Recursively Changing Ownership & Permissions**
### **Why is this important?**
Web servers need correct permissions for all files and directories.

### **Change Ownership for an Entire Directory**
```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
```

### **Apply Secure Permissions to All Files & Folders**
```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

‚úÖ **Expected Result:**  
- **Files** are readable and executable.  
- **Directories** remain accessible.

---

## **Final Takeaways**
‚úîÔ∏è **Check permissions** before executing scripts.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Use `chown`** to assign proper ownership.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Set strict permissions** on sensitive files.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Use groups** to manage shared access.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Protect critical logs from accidental deletion.**

## **Hands-On Challenge**
Set up `/var/www/project` with:
- **www-data** as the owner.
- **755** for directories.
- **644** for files.
