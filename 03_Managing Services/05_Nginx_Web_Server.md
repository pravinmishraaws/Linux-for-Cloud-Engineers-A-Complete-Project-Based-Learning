# **Nginx Web Server: Installation, Configuration, and Advanced Features**  

## **Why Should DevOps and Cloud Engineers Learn Nginx?**  

Imagine you are a **DevOps Engineer** managing a high-traffic web application. Your team complains that the website **slows down under heavy load**. You need a **high-performance, lightweight** web server to optimize response times.  

Or, as a **Cloud Engineer**, you need to **distribute traffic efficiently** across multiple backend servers to ensure **high availability**.  

This is where **Nginx** comes in.  

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:  
✔ **Understand how Nginx works and why it is different from Apache.**  
✔ **Install and configure Nginx on Ubuntu/Debian and CentOS/RHEL.**  
✔ **Set up virtual hosts (server blocks) to host multiple websites.**  
✔ **Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer.**  
✔ **Secure Nginx with HTTPS and IP whitelisting.**  

Let’s begin by understanding **what Nginx is and why it is widely used**.  

---

## **1. Introduction to Nginx**  

Nginx (pronounced "Engine-X") is a **high-performance, lightweight web server** and **reverse proxy**. Unlike Apache, which uses a process-driven model, Nginx uses an **event-driven, asynchronous architecture**, allowing it to:  

- **Handle thousands of connections simultaneously** with minimal memory usage.  
- **Efficiently serve static files** like images, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Act as a reverse proxy** for backend applications like **Node.js, Python, or PHP**.  
- **Load balance traffic** across multiple servers.  

### **Key Features of Nginx**  

| Feature | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **High Concurrency** | Handles multiple client requests simultaneously. |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | Uses a non-blocking I/O model for scalability. |
| **Low Memory Usage** | Requires fewer resources compared to Apache. |
| **Reverse Proxy & Load Balancing** | Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers. |
| **HTTP/2 & SSL/TLS Support** | Ensures secure and optimized connections. |

Now that we understand what Nginx does, let’s explore its architecture.  

---

## **2. Nginx Architecture**  

Nginx follows a **master-worker architecture**, allowing it to efficiently manage connections.  

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Master Process** | Reads configuration files and manages worker processes. |
| **Worker Processes** | Handle client requests asynchronously using event-driven I/O. |

This design ensures **high performance and scalability**, even under **heavy loads**.  

Now, let’s install Nginx on different Linux distributions.  

---

## **3. Installing Nginx**  

### **On Ubuntu/Debian**  

#### **Step 1: Update the Package List**  
```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### **Step 2: Install Nginx**  
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

#### **Step 3: Start and Enable Nginx**  
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

✅ **Verification Step:**  
```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

---

### **On CentOS/RHEL**  

#### **Step 1: Install Nginx**  
```bash
sudo yum install nginx -y
```

#### **Step 2: Start and Enable Nginx**  
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

✅ **Verification Step:**  
```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

Now that Nginx is installed, let’s explore its **configuration files**.  

---

## **4. Nginx Configuration Basics**  

Nginx configuration files control **global settings, server blocks, and logging**.  

| File Type | Location |
|-----------|---------|
| **Main Configuration File** | `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` |
| **Server Block Files (Virtual Hosts)** | `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` |
| **Access Log** | `/var/log/nginx/access.log` |
| **Error Log** | `/var/log/nginx/error.log` |

Now, let’s configure **server blocks** to host multiple websites.  

---

## **5. Setting Up Virtual Hosts (Server Blocks)**  

### **Why Use Server Blocks?**  
- Allows Nginx to **host multiple websites** on a single server.  
- Separates **configuration settings** for different domains.  

---

### **Step 1: Create a Website Directory**  
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/example.com/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/example.com
```

---

### **Step 2: Add a Test File**  
```bash
echo "Welcome to Example.com!" | sudo tee /var/www/example.com/html/index.html
```

---

### **Step 3: Create a Server Block Configuration File**  
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
```
Add the following configuration:  

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;
    root /var/www/example.com/html;
    index index.html;
}
```

---

### **Step 4: Enable the Server Block**  
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

✅ **Test the Configuration:**  
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
If the configuration is valid, **visit `http://example.com`** in your browser.  

Now, let’s explore how Nginx works as a **reverse proxy**.  

---

## **6. Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**  

A **reverse proxy** forwards client requests to **backend servers** running on different ports or machines.  

### **Step 1: Create a Reverse Proxy Configuration**  
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf
```
Add the following configuration:  

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Enable the Reverse Proxy Configuration**  
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now, let’s set up **Nginx as a load balancer**.  

---

## **7. Load Balancing with Nginx**  

Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across **multiple backend servers** to improve performance and availability.  

### **Step 1: Create a Load Balancer Configuration**  
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/load-balancer.conf
```
Add the following configuration:  

```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    server 192.168.1.101;
    server 192.168.1.102;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

### **Step 2: Enable and Reload Nginx**  
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/load-balancer.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

Now, let’s secure Nginx with **HTTPS and access control**.  

---

## **8. Securing Nginx**  

### **Enable HTTPS with Certbot (Let’s Encrypt)**  
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
```
✅ **Verify SSL Renewal:**  
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

---

### **Restrict Access with IP Whitelisting**  
```nginx
location / {
    allow 192.168.1.100;
    deny all;
}
```
